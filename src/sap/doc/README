SAPPLUG - an XMMS plugin for POKEY tunes
----------------------------------------

Sapplug is a POKEY tunes player plugin for X Multimedia System (xmms)
This is a beta release, after first alpha versions seem to work fine.

This, however means that it's still a work-in-progress software, some
features are missing. If you find some bugs - firs look in TODO list 
to check if I am already working on them, same with new features requests.

!!! Check TODO before sending me hate-mail. !!!

USAGE
-----

Just fire up xmms as you would normally and load some SAP tunes. 
In case of not being able to play check in the preferences if 
the plugin is installed and active!!! 
Do not hesitate to mail me if you have problems compiling the plugin,
hovewer, due to limited amount of time, I will not be able to answer any
mail concerning general use of xmms or general plugin installation.
Report problems with *compiling* or *using* *this* plugin !!!

Some notes:

The seekbar is used to switch subsongs within a multi-song SAP.
Just click on it and the player plays next subsong!
The number of songs in a SAP file is displayed in the main xmms window
as X kHz (where X is the number of songs within the SAP file)
This info is also available in the sapfile info box.

File info box is brought up when you click "View file info" in XMMS :)
It gives you general information about SAP file and presents so called
SAP tag. It's a set of name, author and date of the song, similar to an mp3 tag.
You can also edit this SAP tag, i.e. change author, name or date of the song.
Click "Save" and the new tag gets written to the file. Also, you can remove 
the tag from the SAPfile by clicking "Remove Tag" 

Enjoy!!
